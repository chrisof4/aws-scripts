Future work:

2. for Io1 IOPS range is 1000-32000 for MsSQL. (pg. 106)
3. reset screen before presenting output.
4. Include formulas in output and other educational information.
5. If disk throughput is greater than 10K, recommend memory optimized which can handle up to 14K. (pg. 102)
5. If IOPS is less than 3K, recommend burst capable (pg. 102)
